# resumeSite
This website is meant to serve as a resume website for me. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend is built using AWS S3, Terraform, and GitHub Actions. The site can be accessed at [http://calebvarghese.com](http://calebvarghese.com) or [http://caleb-varghese-resume-website-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/](http://caleb-varghese-resume-website-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) if website is up and running.
