# resumeSite
This website is meant to serve as a resume website for me. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend is built using AWS S3, Terraform, and GitHub Actions. The site can be accessed at [http://brianopdahl.com](http://brianopdahl.com) if website is up and running.
